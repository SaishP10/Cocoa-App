            '    <p>Welcome all our valued clients to the Bougainville Cocoa ‘’Mobile based Cocoa app’’ and it is a great pleasure to invite you to use and make the most out this new Agricultural Research, development and extension technological platform.</p>\n' +
            '    <p>This is an important technological development in regards to transfer of information and technologies for cocoa, fresh produce, livestock as well as Cocoa Marketing news and update not only to farmers but also to entrepreneurs, DPI and Cocoa board officers, students & teachers and any other interested person alone the Cocoa value chain and the general farming sectors in Bougainville (or PNG).</p>\n' +
            '    <p>Cocoa is an important commodity for the Bougainville’s Economy as it brings significant revenue to the Autonomous Region of Bougainville which helps the farmers improve their livelihoods. The information in the Cocoa app provides information on how we can improve our annual cocoa production which had shrunk from over 20,000  tonnes to around 10,000 tonnes since 2009. Among other information, it is my wish and believe that Bougainville Cocoa beans must be ranked one of best in Quality and flavor (or 90-100% fine flavored) beans through better fermentation and drying equipment with great emphasis on solar drying or a combination of Solar and kiln hot air drying and thus eliminating or reducing the problem of smoke tainted beans. Market and trade of Cocoa Bougainville to international buyers need to strengthen through this app.</p>\n' +
            '    <p>On behalf of my Government (the Autonomous Bougainville Government) I wish to acknowledge and thank the tireless contributions of many professional scientists, researchers Academics and experts from various International and national organization, more specifically to the Australian Aid funded  ‘’DPI/ACIAR Project : HORT 2014/094: <b>Developing Cocoa Value Chain in Bougainville</b>’’) with Partners (University of Sydney, PNG University of Natural Resources and Environment, Cocoa Board of PNG, and the ABG-Department of Primary Industries).</p>\n' +
            '    <p>I Fully acknowledge the Developer of this Cocoa app and certainly invite all users of the Cocoa app in Bougainville, PNG and the rest of the world to enjoy and learn as much as you can while taking advantage of this new technological platform. The App will be updated with new information regularly as new information becomes available and please share this app with other mobile phones users so that we can reach as many people as possible especially in the farming communities.</p>\n' +

            '<p><i>Phytophthora pod rot, also known as black pod, is the most serious disease of cocoa. It is caused by Phytophthora palmivora. The name means destroyer of palms because it was first identified causing bud rot on coconuts, although it infect hundreds of different plant species including cocoa. It is a microbe that spreads by releasing swimming spores – see the video – which means it loves water and is most severe during wet weather.</i></p>' +
            '<p><i>Pod infections first appear as small black spots on pods of all ages. These spots expand over several days until the entire pod turns black and the beans inside rot and will not ferment. In wet weather the black surface becomes covered in fluffy white spore masses that spread by rainsplash or are carried from diseased to healthy pods on the bodies of flying beetles. Eventually black pods dry out to become pod mummies, which if left on the tree become a source of infection for new epidemics when it next rains. Every pod mummy has the potential to start 100 million new infections!</i></p>' +
            '<p><i>The most effective way of managing black pod rot is to frequently remove infected pods and mummies – “every pod, every tree, every week”. Bury or compost diseased pods and prunings. Pruning and shade tree management will open the canopy, and along with improved drainage will reduce water splashing, increase air flow, reduce humidity and lead to lower levels of spore production, spread and infection. Fungicides and products sold to boost plant immunity are expensive and of limited value on smallholder farms. Regular harvesting and good sanitation is the most effective control measure available to smallholder cocoa farmers.</i></p>' +

            '<p>Canker is caused by the same microbe that causes black pod and leaf blight, Phytophthora palmivora, and is also most serious in poorly managed blocks following wet weather. However, instead of infecting pods, the pathogen infects the bark and stops nutrients flowing around the tree. It can ringbark the tree, cutting off nutrient flow to the roots which can kill the tree. In the Solomon Islands canker has been reported to kill 10% of trees in a block every year.</p>' +
            '<p>Canker can be reduced by following good IPDM – removing infected pods and branches and pruning cocoa and shade trees to reduce humidity and ponding. In addition, scrape the bark from bleeding cankers and apply a paste of copper or phosphite fungicide such as “Agrifos”.</p>' +

            '<p>Cocoa pod borer is a small moth that lays its eggs on developing cocoa pods. When the eggs hatch they burrow into the pod and eat the placenta. This stops the beans developing, resulting in unevenly ripened pods containing shrivelled beans that fail to ferment properly and clump when dried. Cocoa bean buyers discount the price paid for these poor-quality beans.</p>' +
            '<p>CPB is one of those pests that isn’t present in the areas cocoa originated. We think the moth originated on rainforest fruit trees in Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific, like tau, but developed a taste for cocoa when they discovered that pods were available year-round. While CPB has been a problem in Malaysia and Indonesia for many years, it was first reported in PNG in 2006, when it then devastated the cocoa industry in East New Britain and spread to Bougainville soon after, where it has established itself as a serious problem in Central and Northern Bougainville.</p>' +

            '<p>Vascular-streak dieback is caused by an elusive fungus now called Ceratobasidium theobromae. It was first identified in East New Britain by Dr Phillip Keane who was investigating the cause of a dieback disease destroying large plantings of cocoa. The symptoms were new, and the disease is still only found in Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific. So far it has not been reported in Bougainville.</p>' +
            '<p>As far as we know still the fungus only infects cocoa, although we suspect it lives on a plant in the rainforest where it does not cause disease symptoms. Disease symptoms have only been reported on cocoa and avocado, neither of which originated in Asia or the Pacific.</p>' +
            '<p>The fungus produces spores during extended periods of continuously wet weather. The spores are thought to infect young leaf flushes then grow into the leaf veins, then into shoots and stems where it blocks water flow. Infected stems show the typical brown veins and infected leaves then turn yellow or brown and fall off. As the fungus grows down the stem all the leaves fall off the branch causing characteristic dieback, and the bark develops a rough “puk-puk” feel. In seedlings and susceptible cocoa varieties the main trunk becomes infected and the tree dies. Most varieties of cocoa now grown in PNG aren’t killed by the fungus, but yields are significantly reduced if infections are left uncontrolled.</p>' +
            '<p>IPDM encourages tree vigour and sanitary pruning by removing infected branches at least 20 cm below any sign of internal stem browning removes infected branches and stimulates healthy regrowth.

            '<p>The cocoa tree originated in South America where it lived with many microbes and insects – some beneficial like mycorrhizae and pollinators – while others were harmful and caused diseases and damage when feeding off the trees and pods, especially when cocoa trees were planted close together.</p>' +
            '<p>Some of these microbes and insects were carried around the world when new cocoa industries were established by colonialists, and others jumped from local plants onto the newly planted cocoa.</p>' +
            '<p>In Asia and the Pacific this is how VSD and CPB came to attack cocoa. Both are indigenous and associated with local native hosts. While cocoa was new to them, they adapted quickly because of the ready supply of food from dense plantings that produce fruits all year round. Because these pests and pathogens were new threats, the cocoa trees had not evolved any defences and many became important diseases, while others have become persistent but low-level problems. </p>' +
            '<p>The biggest threats to global cocoa production are cocoa swollen shoot disease in West Africa and Witches’ Broom and Frosty Pod Rot in Latin America. Cocoa Swollen Shoot disease is caused by a virus that jumped from local forest trees, while Witches’ Broom and Frosty Pod Rot were always present on cocoa in different parts of Latin America, but became serious when dense plantations were established and the fungi responsible crossed the Andes mountains. Neither have yet been reported in Asia or the Pacific and their introduction and escape would be devastating.</p>' +
            '<p>A number of fungi cause wilt diseases. Symptoms start as drooping, yellow leaves that turn brown and fall off. Most start in the roots or from wounds and grow in the vascular system that carries water from the soil to the leaves. It is usually possible to see dark staining in the infected wood.

            '<b>Iron-rich foods</b>'+'<p>Both animal and plant foods have iron. Heme iron is commonly found in animal products and is more easily absorbed by the body. Non-heme iron can be found in fruits and vegetables. This type of iron is less easily absorbed by the body but is still important to eat. You can increase absorption of iron by eating foods rich in Vitamin C at the same time. For example, eating dark green leafy vegetables with orange kau kau.</p>'+

            '<li>People with diets rich in vegetables and fruit have a significantly lower risk of obesity, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and certain types of cancer.</li>'+
            '<li>Eat rainbow meals. Eating fruits and vegetables of different colours every day will increase your intake of different nutrients for better health.</li>'+'</ul>' +
            '<b>Eat less fat</b>'+'<ul>'+'<li>Eating the wrong kinds of fat, like saturated and commercially-produced trans-fat, increase the risk of heart disease and stroke.</li>'+
            '<li>Using unsaturated vegetable oils such as olive, soy, sunflower, or corn oil is better for you because animal fats or oils high in saturated fats (butter, ghee, lard, coconut and palm oil) contain unhealthy fats.</li>'+
            '<li>'+'<p>The evidence shows that coconut oil is neither a superfood nor a poison. Coconut oil is best consumed in small amounts, because it is about 90% saturated fat, which is a higher percentage than butter (about 64% saturated fat), beef fat (40%), or even lard (also 40%). Too much saturated fat in the diet is unhealthy because it increases the risk of heart disease'+'</p>'+'<img src="/assets/recommendations-for-healthy-eating/image-2.png">'+'<p>Image by  Filo gèn</p>'+'<a href=”https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/”>https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/</a>'+'</li>'+'</ul>'+
            '<b>Limit intake of sugars</b>'+'<p>Consuming free sugars increases the risk of tooth ache and decay. Excess calories from foods and drinks high in free sugars also contribute to unhealthy weight gain, which can lead to overweight and obesity. Recent evidence also shows that free sugars influence blood pressure and serum lipids, and suggests that a reduction in free sugars intake reduces risk factors</p>'+'<ul>'+'<li>For a healthy diet, you should try to reduce the amount of sugar you eat.</li>'+
            '<li>Choosing fresh fruits instead of sweet snacks such as cookies, cakes and chocolate helps reduce consumption of sugars.</li>'+
            '<li>Limiting intake of soft drinks, soda, and other drinks high in sugars (fruit juices, cordials and syrups, flavoured milks, and yogurt drinks) also helps reduce intake of sugars.'+
            '</li>'+'</ul>'+
            '<b>Reduce salt intake</b>'+'<p>People are often unaware of the amount of salt they consume. In Bougainville most salt comes from processed foods. Salt is also added to foods during cooking (bouillon, stock cubes, soy sauce and fish sauce) or at the point of consumption (table salt).</p>'+'<p>Salt intake can be reduced by:</p>'+'<ul>'+'<li>Eating very small amounts of salt will help prevent hypertension and reduces the risk of heart disease and stroke in adults.</li>'+

            '<li>limiting the consumption of salty snacks; and</li>'+
            '<li>choosing products with lower sodium content</li>'+'</ul>'+
            '<p>use herbs, spices, lemon juice or vinegar to add flavour; and - make your own stock and gravy instead of using stock cubes or powder.</p>'+
            '<b>Why is eating a healthy diet important</b>'+'<p>Eating healthy food throughout your life helps to prevent malnutrition in all its forms as well as a range of noncommunicable diseases and conditions. Many villages buy processed foods such as one-minute noodles and other store-bought items such as soft drinks which are all high in energy, fats, free sugars, and salt/sodium.  This has led to many people not eating enough fruit, vegetables, and other dietary fibre such as whole grains.</p>'+
            '<b>Practical advice on maintaining a healthy diet</b>'+'<b><u>Fruit and vegetables</u></b>'+'<ul>'+'<li>eat at least five portions of fruit and vegetables each day</li>'+'<li>reduces the risk of diseases and helps to ensure an adequate daily intake of dietary fibre.</li>'+'<li>Fruit and vegetable intake can be improved by:</li>'+'<li>always including vegetables in meals</li>'+'<li>eating fresh fruit and vegetables that are in season</li>'+'<li>eating a variety of fruit and vegetables.</li></ul>'+
